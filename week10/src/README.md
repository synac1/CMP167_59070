#Inheritance
When a  child class inherits the attributes and behaviours from the parent class.
Child Class can also be called subclass, and a parent class can also be called Base Class or Super Class.

The keyword to explicitly inherit from another class is **extends**

```
public NameOfChildClass extends NameOfParentClass{
	public NameChildClass(){
		super();
	}
}

```
