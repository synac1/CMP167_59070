# Selection sort 
{2, 1, 0, 6, 3}
- Grab the minimum value of the array [0, length-1] and putting at the beginning of the the array [0, length -1]
1 iteration 
{0, 1, 2, 6, 3}

Grab the minimum value of the array [1, length-1] and putting at the beginning of the the array  [1, length -1] 

{0, 1, 2, 6, 3}

Grab the minimum value of the array [2, length-1] and putting at the beginning of the the array  [2, length -1]

## MergeSort
{3, 8, 4, 6, 2, 1}

{3, 8, 4} {6, 2, 1}
{3, 8} {4}, {6, 2}, {1}
{3, 4, 8}  {1, 2, 6}
{1, 2,3, 4, 6, 8}

Iteractive: 
```
public static void merge(int[] arr, int left, int mid, int right){
