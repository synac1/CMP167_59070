## Sorting Algorithms 
#Bubble Sort

As a human being how would you approach sorting the array below?
{3, 5, 1, 4, 2, 3}

1- look at first element and compare it with the one next to it 
2- If the right side element is smaller than the left side element swap and move on 
3- If the left side element is smaller than the right side leave it as it, move 

4- Then repeat all over
{3, 5, 1, 4, 2, 3}

{3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 3}

{3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3}

{3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3}

{3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5}

-------
{1, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5}

{1, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5}

{1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5}

{1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5}

{1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5}
---- Repeat
